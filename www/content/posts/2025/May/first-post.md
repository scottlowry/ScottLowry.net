I recently set up a personal Microsoft 365 lab environment to practice and test security configurations. Here's what I'm working with:

## The Setup

- **Tenant**: Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- **Licenses**: Entra ID P2, Intune, Defender for Endpoint
- **Key Features**:
  - Conditional Access policies
  - Privileged Identity Management
  - Data Loss Prevention
  - Device compliance policies

## Why a Lab?

Having a dedicated lab environment lets me:
- Test security configurations safely
- Practice implementing Zero Trust principles
- Stay current with new Microsoft 365 features
- Prepare for certifications (currently working on AZ-500)

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write more detailed posts about:
- Setting up Conditional Access policies
- Implementing PIM
- Configuring device compliance
- Automating common tasks

Stay tuned for more technical deep-dives into these topics!
